1) Seperate load/save for head/sub comments?
2) Change return type of CommentDataController.loadFromFile(or loadHeadsFromFile?) to ArrayList<HeadModel>?
3) List of head models in MainListViewActivity(or CommentDataController) instead of MainListViewAdapter?
4) Able to get the "No Image" icon to put into the resources and thus use as the default image for the comment?
5) Do we need different resolutions for each screen type(i.e. for hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi and xxhdpi?)
6)
